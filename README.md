    * `Element.closest()` polyfill (not included) required for IE11 and Edge <15

### Additional (non-standard) Features

* Restoring focus when a modal dialog is closed
* Automatic closing of the dialog when the backdrop is clicked


## Installation

The polyfill can be installed from npm:

```bash
npm install ay-dialog
```


## Usage

There are 3 varieties included in the package, offering a polyfill for strictly
the spec-compliant behaviour, a polyfill with additional features, and a Web
Component custom element.

### Polyfill with Extras

A polyfill implementation of the `<dialog>` element and additional behaviour in
all modern browsers.

```javascript
// ES6 import:
import 'ay-dialog/index.js';

// CommonJS require:
require('ay-dialog');
```

### Pure Spec Polyfill

A polyfill implementation for the `<dialog>` element in all modern browsers,
matching spec behaviour as closely as possible. No extra behaviour.

```javascript
// ES6 import:
import 'ay-dialog/polyfill.js';

// CommonJS require:
require('ay-dialog/polyfill');
```

### `ay-dialog` Custom Element

An implementation of the dialog spec and additional behaviour as a
`<ay-dialog>` custom element. This only works in modern browsers with support
for HTML custom elements.

```javascript
// ES6 import:
import 'ay-dialog/component.js';

// CommonJS require:
require('ay-dialog/component');
```
